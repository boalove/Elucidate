## Output Options

- Add Suffix: Creates a new file in the same directory with the preferred suffix.

## Conversion Options
- Make Searchable: Adds searchable text to the PDF overtop of the original image.
- Split Pages: Detects side-by-side pages and splits only these into two pages.
- Adjust Tilt: Adjusts the tilt if the page was scanned at an angle.

## (Brief) Tips and Acknowlegements
- The better the scan quality, the better the results.
- OCR can be very processor intensive, so it's best to be plugged into a power source before converting.
- Elucidate is powered by [Tesseract OCR](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/) and builds off of [Tesseract-iOS](https://github.com/gali8/Tesseract-OCR-iOS).
